  <h2>The Life of a Penguin</h2>
</section>
<section id="main">
    <p> Penguins spend roughly half their lives on land, and half in the ocean. They primarily eat krill, fish and squid. Most penguins mate for life, and the male will search the beach for the perfect pebble to give to his female, like a proposal.</p>
