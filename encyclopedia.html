  <h2>What are penguins and where do they live?</h2>
    <p> There are 18 different species of pengiuns, 11 of them are considered to be globally threatened. While we usually associate penguins with living in Antartica, some species live in much warmer climates.</p>

  <h2>The Life of a Penguin</h2>
    <p> Penguins spend roughly half their lives on land, and half in the ocean. They primarily eat krill, fish and squid. Most penguins mate for life, and the male will search the beach for the perfect pebble to give to his female, like a proposal.</p>
