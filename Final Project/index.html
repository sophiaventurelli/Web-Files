    <p>Nicholas D. Miller, born December 26, 1990, known professionally as Illenium, is an American musician, DJ, and record producer. He has released four studio albums, his most recent being Fallen Embers, released in July 2021. It earned Illenium his first Grammy nomination. One of Illenium's more notable albums, Ascend, was released in August 2019 on Astralwerks. The album was Illenium's first to top the Billboard Dance/Electronic Albums chart and also reached his highest peak on the Billboard 200 at number 14. Nicholas D. Miller was born in Chicago, Illinois, United States on December 26, 1990. He was raised in San Francisco. In 2008, Miller began producing electronic music. In the summer of 2012, he saw Bassnectar perform at Red Rocks Amphitheatre and decided to focus more earnestly on music. That year, he also suffered a heroin overdose; a fact he shared with his fans in 2018. The experience was the inspiration for his 2018 song, "Take You Down". In 2013, Miller moved to Denver, where he continues to reside. From 2013 to 2014, he was enrolled in the Music & Entertainment Industry Studies Department at the University of Colorado Denver. His music emphasis was Recording Arts and he attended classes for two years. He made many connections in the Denver music scene while taking courses in music business, performance, and recording arts. During this period he completed his first EP. He also coached lacrosse and delivered sushi to support himself.
