      <h1>Trilogy</h1>
      <p>The first show in Allegiant Stadium, Illenium performed special event 'Trilogy'. A 4-hour performance including sets dedicated to his first three albums, and a sneak peak at his then upcoming album Fallen Embers.</p>

      <p>The stadium held around 35,000 people all wearing lit up Trilogy bracelets, provided on entry. The bracelets synced up with the show’s visuals adding to the already amazing production. At the end he sat and spoke about the meaning behind the 'Trilogy' albums, and his phoenix emblem. "He said it was crazy how it transitioned into a trilogy representing the Phoenix and the transition of his shitty life that is now in the past. He couldn’t believe that he was now playing in a football stadium. He told the attendees that his fans and the music are the reason why he keeps going everyday and how his music isn’t going anywhere." The Trilogy show was the perfect way to say goodbye to his older albums and welcome the newest generation of his music.</p>

He brought out numerous special guests, including long time friend and frequent collaborator DJ Said the Sky. Other suprise guests included Tori Kelly and Sueco, both the vocals behind two of Illenium's newest songs</p>
